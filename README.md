a journal app

Two things

One thing it is is a document organization system

A very, dirt simple one

You tag documents with hierarchical tags and it mirrors the tags onto the filesystem

Second thing is

It's a log for cycles

The implication is, behavioral cycles

You have a good day, then "Good" is "On"

You listen to some gangsta rap, then "Gangsta rap" is "On"

(for that day)(edited)

And you can use the viewer to find patterns
